# Arduino Libraries Repository

This repository contains a collection of Arduino libraries for various functionalities, such as voice recognition, LCD control, thermistors, and WiFi connectivity.

## Libraries

1. **LiquidCrystal_I2C**: 
   - A library to control I2C LCD displays, providing a simple interface for writing to the display.

2. **NTC_Thermistor**: 
   - A library to read temperature from NTC thermistors.

3. **Seeed-GroveOfflineVoiceRecognition**: 
   - A library for offline voice recognition using Grove modules.

4. **VoiceRecognitionV3**: 
   - A library for controlling and interfacing with the V3 version of a voice recognition module.

5. **WiFiEsp**: 
   - A library for controlling the ESP8266 module to provide WiFi capabilities for Arduino projects.

## Installation

To install these libraries, you can either download the ZIP files and extract them into your Arduino libraries folder (`Documents/Arduino/libraries`), or you can use the Arduino Library Manager (if available for certain libraries).

### Manual Installation

1. Download the repository as a ZIP file.
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file.
3. Copy the desired libraries into your Arduino `libraries` folder, located in `Documents/Arduino/libraries`.

## Usage

Each library folder contains the source files necessary for using the library in your Arduino project. Check the `examples` folder within each library directory for sample code on how to use the library.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the documentation or example sketches provided with each library.

## License
